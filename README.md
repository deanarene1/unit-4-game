# unit-4-game

In this game, I used JavaScript to generate a random number at the start of the game. There are four different crystal icons that can be picked and each holds a hidden (also randomly generated) number that is unknown until clicked. The amount of each crystal will then begin to add up per user click based on the crystal amount, the total is stored the entire time.

The game ends by the user going over the randomly generated amount at the beginning, which results in a loss, OR if the user correctly matches their total amount to the randomly generated amount, resulting in a win.
